16428,17362,"The majority has put it thus:-

The ratio which can be culled out from these decisions can broadly be stated as follows:
(i) Adjudication proceedings and criminal prosecution can be launched simultaneously;
(ii) Decision in adjudication proceedings is not neces- sary before initiating criminal prosecution;
(iii) Adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are independent in nature to each other;
(iv) The finding against the person facing prosecution in the adjudication proceedings is not binding on the pro- ceeding for criminal prosecution;
(v) Adjudication proceedings by the Enforcement Di- rectorate is not prosecution by a competent court of law to attract the provisions of Article 20(2) of the Constitu- tion or Section 300 of the Code of Criminal Procedure;
(vi) The finding in the adjudication proceedings in favour of the person facing trial for identical violation will depend upon the nature of finding.",['PRE_RELIED'],b28c921dcc35440aa4a6643d6e37f03e_97
17363,17800,"If the exoneration in adjudication proceedings is on technical ground and not on merit, prosecution may continue; and
(vii) In case of exoneration, however, on merits where the allegation is found to be not sustainable at all and the person held innocent, criminal prosecution on the same set of facts and circumstances cannot be allowed to continue, the underlying principle being the higher stan- dard of proof in criminal cases.
