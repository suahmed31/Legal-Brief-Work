# Legal-Brief-Work
This repository is for developing a framework for legal briefs or case brief. A case brief is a dissection of a judicial opinion -- it contains a written summary of the basic components of that decision. Case briefing helps you acquire the skills of case analysis and legal reasoning. Briefing a case helps you understand it.  

Case briefing aids your memory. Briefs help you remember the cases you read (1) for class discussion, (2) for end-of-semester review for final examinations, and (3) for writing and analyzing legal problems. 

**CaseBriefs** folder contains sample case briefs for indian cases. Case Judgements for each case briefs are stored in **CaseJudgements** folder.

We have used OpenNyAi based BUILD Model to create the Rhetorical Roles (RR). You can find the details about the Rhetorical Role Baseline at the Git Hub link https://github.com/Legal-NLP-EkStep/rhetorical-role-baseline. 

Once, we get the RRs, we can now process them further for creating a Case Brief.
